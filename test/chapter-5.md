## Chapter Vocabulary
- **Right angle:**  An angle 90° in measure.
- **Theta (θ):**    A symbol used to denote the unknown measure of an angle. It is used mostly in displaying the trigonometric ratios of sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent.
- **Hypotenuse:**   In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side that is opposite from the right angle. Commonly represented by $$ c $$.
- **Opposite:**     A term used to describe an angle facing a side or a side facing an angle. _e.g.: hypotenuse opposite the right angle_
- **Adjacent:**     A term used to describe an angle or side right next to another.
- **Sine:**         The trigonometric function that is equal to the ratio of the side opposite a given angle (in a right triangle) to the hypotenuse.
- **Cosine:**       The trigonometric function that is equal to the ratio of the side adjacent to an acute angle (in a right triangle) to the hypotenuse.
- **Tangent:**      The trigonometric function that is equal to the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side (in a right triangle) to the hypotenuse.
- **Cotangent:**    The trigonometric function that is equal to the ratio of the adjacent side to the opposite side (in a right triangle) to the hypotenuse.
- **Secant:**       The secant of an angle in a right triangle is the value found by dividing length of the hypotenuse by the length of the side adjacent the given angle.
- **Cosecant:**     The secant of an angle in a right triangle is the value found by dividing length of the hypotenuse by the length of the side opposite the given angle.

## Radians and Degrees

Radians and degrees are two different ways of quantifying a proportional piece of a circle. A degree is a $$ \frac{1}{360} $$ of a circle, and a radian is $$ \frac{1}{2\pi} $$ of a circle.

### Unit Conversions
For degrees to radians:
$$
\frac{degrees*\pi}{180}=radians
$$

For radians to degrees:
$$
\frac{radians*180}{\pi}=degrees
$$

## Unit Circle
A visual comparison of the different ways radians and degrees align is the unit circle. The coordinate pairs are arranged so that $$(x,y)$$ follows the form $$(\cos,\sin)$$.
![Unit Circle](https://www.fotolip.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Unit-Circle-1.png)
The unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1 that can be used to easily understand complex problems. The unit circle and trigonometry dates back to the 2nd millennium BC to Egyptian mathematics and Babylonian mathematics. Who used trigonometry to map the stars and create great empires. The unit circle or trigonometric circle is used to easily find sine, cosine, and tangent for any degree between 0 and 360 (0 to 2π radians).

## Identities

### Reciprocal Identities
Reciprocal Identities tell us the reciprocals of each trigonometric function. They define a trigonometric function in terms of another trigonometric function.

$$ \sin{\theta}=\frac{1}{\csc{\theta}} $$|$$ \cos{\theta}=\frac{1}{\sec{\theta}} $$|$$ \tan{\theta}=\frac{1}{\cot{\theta}} $$

$$ \csc{\theta}=\frac{1}{\sin{\theta}} $$|$$ \sec{\theta}=\frac{1}{\cos{\theta}} $$|$$ \cos{\theta}=\frac{1}{\tan{\theta}} $$|

### Quotient Identities
Quotient identities define the relation for tangent and cotangent in terms of sine and cosine. 

$$ \tan{\theta}=\frac{\sin{\theta}}{\cos{\theta}} $$|$$ \cot{\theta}=\frac{\cos{\theta}}{\sin{\theta}} $$

### Pythagorean Identities
The Pythagorean Identities consist of three identities that come from the Pythagorean Theorem, which help find where a point is on the Unit Circle.

$$ \sin^{2}\theta+\cos^{2}\theta=1 $$

$$ 1+\cot^{2}\theta=\csc^{2}\theta $$

$$ \tan^{2}\theta+1=\sec^{2}\theta $$

## Graphing trigonometric functions

![Trig Graphs](http://img.sparknotes.com/figures/A/ad79275cb59e569b790cb945a4ffc553/triggraphs.gif)
These graphs are all very different in their own right, but there are a fair few similarities in some of them. The co- variants of each function are proportional to their original function, which is why sine and cosine look similar, tangent and cotangent look similar, etc.
