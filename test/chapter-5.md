## Radians and Degrees

Radians and degrees are two different ways of quantifying a proportional piece of a circle. A degree is a $$ \frac{1}{360} $$ of a circle, and a radian is $$ \frac{1}{2\pi} $$ of a circle.

### Unit Conversions
For degrees to radians:
$$
\frac{degrees*\pi}{180}=radians
$$

For radians to degrees:
$$
\frac{radians*180}{\pi}=degrees
$$

## Unit Circle
A visual comparison of the different ways radians and degrees align is the unit circle. The coordinate pairs are arranged so that $$(x,y)$$ follows the form $$(\cos,\sin)$$.

The unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1 that can be used to easily understand complex problems. The unit circle and trigonometry dates back to the 2nd millennium BC to Egyptian mathematics and Babylonian mathematics. Who used trigonometry to map the stars and create great empires. The unit circle or trig circle is used to easily find sine, cosine, and tangent for any degree between 0 and 360 (0 to 2Ï€ radians).

## Identities

### Reciprocal Identities
Reciprocal Identities tell us the reciprocals of each trig function. They define a trig function in terms of another trig function.
