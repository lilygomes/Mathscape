## Domain Restrictions of Trigonometric Functions
$$ \sin^{-1}(x) $$|$$ [-1,1] $$
$$ \cos^{-1}(x) $$|$$ [-1,1] $$|
$$ \tan^{-1}(x) $$|$$ [-\infty,\infty] $$|

When drawing an inverse sine, cosine or tangent graphs you must first determine the restrictions on the graph. Before you can inverse the graph you must look for an area that passes the horizontal line test. Then you must restrict the equation to this area. Then you can take the inverse without any problems.

ex: $$ y=\sin x $$

**Step 1:** Find an area that passes the horizontal line test.

In this example, that would be $$ [-\pi 2,\pi 2] $$.

**Step 2:** Take that section of the graph and invert it.

**Step 3:** Record the domain and range of the inverted area. *Tip: the domain and range will be switched from the parent function, and all points of the parent function will have their x and y swapped.*


Equation: $$ y=\sin^-1(x) $$
Domain: $$ [-1,1] $$
Range: $$ [-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}] $$
