## Domain Restrictions of Trigonometric Functions
$$ \sin^{-1}(x) $$|$$ [-1,1] $$

$$ \cos^{-1}(x) $$|$$ [-1,1] $$|

$$ \tan^{-1}(x) $$|$$ [-\infty,\infty] $$|

When drawing an inverse sine, cosine or tangent graph you must first determine the restrictions on the graph. Before you can inverse the graph you must look for an area that passes the horizontal line test. Then you must restrict the equation to this area. Then you can take the inverse without any problems.

ex: $$ y=\sin x $$

**Step 1:** Find an area that passes the horizontal line test.

In this example, that would be $$ [-\pi 2,\pi 2] $$.

**Step 2:** Take that section of the graph and invert it.

**Step 3:** Record the domain and range of the inverted area. *Tip: the domain and range will be switched from the parent function, and all points of the parent function will have their x and y swapped.*


Equation: $$ y=\sin^-1(x) $$
Domain: $$ [-1,1] $$
Range: $$ [-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}] $$

## Finding Composite Trigonometric Values

## Solving Trigonometric Equations

The goal of solving trigonometric equations is to find the value or solution set of $$\theta$$. Trig equations can be solved similarly to solving a normal equation to find the unknown value. The steps can be considered as the following:

1.	Isolate the unknown value
2.	Using the unit circle, find the solution set to the equation
3.	To find the other values, add the period to each value of the solution set.

ex: $$ 2\sin\theta+3=2 $$

**Step 1:** Subtract the constant value of 3 from both sides of the equation. 
$$ 2\sin\theta=-1 $$

**Step 2:** Next, simpliy by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.
$$ \sin\theta=-\frac{1}{2} $$

**Step 3:** Using the unit circle, find the two theta values or the solution set that complies with the above. In this case, they are $$ \frac{7\pi}{6} $$ & $$ \frac{11\pi}{6} $$.

**Step 4:** Add the period to the two values to get the remaining values. The period of sine is $$2\pi$$, so $$2\pi$$ will be added.
$$ \frac{7\pi}{6} $$, $$ \frac{11\pi}{6} $$, $$ \frac{19\pi}{6} $$, $$ \frac{23\pi}{6} $$.

## Trigonometric Identities

In order to solve a Trigonometric Identity, the goal is to prove that one side of an equation is equal to the other side. A trigonometric identity is not proven to be equal, so unlike inequalities, you are only allowed to manipulate one side of the equation at a time, and not both at the same time.

ex: $$\tan\theta(\cos\theta)=\sin\theta$$

In order to solve this identity, we attempt to simplify one of the sides using the trigonometric identities covered in chapter 5 in order to make it exactly equal to the other. We always try to simplify the more complicated side, as trying to make the simpler side more complicated is much more difficult. As the complexity increases, it becomes harder to tell which side is the more complicated one, and you may have to toy with changing both sides in order to solve the identity. In this case, we only have to change $$\tanÎ¸$$ to $$\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}$$ using the quotient trig identity and then multiply to prove this identity true.

ex: $$\frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta} * \cos\theta = \sin\theta$$ becomes $$\sin\theta = \sin\theta$$

Generally speaking, you always want to try and change things to sine and cosine. This is not always the solution, but it will get you pretty far most of the time.  Let's work through another example.

ex: $$\cos\theta+\sec\theta=\frac{\cos^{2}\theta+1}{\cos\theta}$$
